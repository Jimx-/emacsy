* Emacsy TODO
  - [ ] have backtraces go to logs
  - [ ] If module (emacsy emacsy) does not load, it may be because it did
    not compile. Please show the correct error.
  - [ ] Make the read-from-minibuffer accept a symbol for a history
  - [ ] Make the default read-from-minibuffer history symbol be (what-command-am-i)
  - [ ] Add a couple of variations on the webkit browser
    - [ ] make it use multiple buffers
    - [ ] make it use multiple windows
  - [ ] get rid of noise in emacsy (noise?) log noise?
  - [ ] implement coroutines in Guile using [[http://www.lua.org/manual/5.2/manual.html][Lua API]] and [[http://wingolog.org/archives/2011/08/30/the-gnu-extension-language][this]] as a basis
    It'd be nice if the coroutines were interruptable.  Maybe [[http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/guile-user/2011-10/msg00038.html][this would help.]]
    This is a [[http://pllab.is.ocha.ac.jp/~asai/cw2011tutorial/main-e.pdf][good tutorial]] on shift and reset.

    Commands should be marked as suspendable.  Suspendable commands
    will be executed in their own coroutine that may be suspended,
    resumed, resumed in the background, or killed.  This is similar to
    the split between builtin commands in shell and regular commands.
    God, this is going to be COOL!
  - [ ] make debugging work in emacsy
  - [ ] fix kill of all buffers bug
  - [ ] add universal argument C-u
  - [ ] clear the echo area once other messages start to come.
  - [ ] figure out how to integrate a browser window, it'll show pdf
    graphs, images, etc. too!
  - [ ] implement separate histories for read-from-minibuffer
  - [ ] there should be a way to turn off the display/runloop from happening.
  - [ ] make emacsy work with copy/paste [[http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6888862/how-to-access-clipboard-data-programmatically][link]]

    Emacs
  - [ ] How to make [[http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/docs/docs-2.0/guile-ref/Identifier-Macros.html#Identifier-Macros][variable aliases]]
  - [ ] the noweb filter docs2comments does not work with noweb's line pragmas
  - [ ] how to do [[https://github.com/davexunit/gnumaku/blob/rebirth/gnumaku/coroutine.scm][coroutines]] in guile
  - [ ] How do syscalls work when Emacsy is in batch mode?
    
    Populate event buffer from file handle?  Are syscalls even required
    if we're not in interactive mode?
  - [X] In order to terminate potential rogue coroutines, I could set
    a posix alarm that runs every second or so to check the events.
  - Readline already offers some completion functions for files
    and defines.

  - [[http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs_modernization.html][Emacs modernization]] may have some good ideas to apply to Emacsy
  - [ ] How to test Emacsy interactions?  It should accept a filehandle that
    specifies events and plays them back like a macro.
  - [[http://cygwin.com/ml/guile-emacs/2000-q2/msg00029.html][These folks]] are thinking similarly about how to deal with
    commands running in the background
  - [ ] Change shebang lines from #!/usr/bin/env perl to #!@PERL@ etc.
  - [ ] configure.ac needs to deal with the case where no hello-emacsy
    is available.
  - [ ] GLUT needs to be checked at configure time on other OSes.
  - An interesting way to [[http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/guile-user/2011-10/msg00038.html][debug at the prompt]] in Guile
  - [ ] Use DBus as a way to interoperate between Emacsy applications.
  - [ ] Swap out blocking module for either ethreads or another
    general continuation method.
  - [ ] Fix bug with (define-interactive name (let ((x 1)) (lambda () (incr! x))))
